# async-benches

A number of assorted benchmarks to measure I/O and programs across various
platforms, metrics, and implementations.

Each subdirectory represents a class of benchmarks which typically have a bunch
of Cargo projects beneath them with different implementations of that benchmark.
More information can be found in each sub-README.
